Schedulizer
===========

Check a web page for a specific element, and run a diff on it.  If it's changed from the last check, send an email with the diff!


Requirements
------------

- Python 2.7+
- Redis
- Celery
- Requests
- Beautiful Soup
- Supervisor

You'll need a place to host this, a Mandrill account, and a webpage (or any HTML document) that you want to monitor.


Usage
-----

You can run this app in one of two ways: as a stand-alone command (handy to do manual site diffs or join up with a Cron task or Herou's Scheduler), or as a running process via Celery.

### Stand-alone

First off, you're doing this in a virtual environment.  You have to be, right?  So make sure you've installed everything properly:

    virtualenv beatwatch-venv --distribute
    source ./beatwatch/bin/activate

Run the task thusly:

    python site-scraper.py


### Celery

#### Worker/Beat

Start the worker:

    celery -A offline.tasks worker --config=offline.celeryconfig --loglevel=info

Start the scheduler:

    celery beat --config="offline.celeryconfig" --loglevel="info" --schedule="/tmp/celerybeat_schedule.db"

And as with all background processes, you'll probably want to [daemonize Celery](http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/master/tutorials/daemonizing.html), and then run it via [Supervisord](https://github.com/celery/celery/tree/master/extra/supervisord) (or init.d, launchd, etc.).


#### Single-worker

Rather than running workers and the `beat` task, run a single worker in beat mode (if you know this will only ever be one worker â€” especially handy for running on services like Heroku).  This way, you can run everything with one command:

    celery -A offline.tasks worker --config=offline.celeryconfig --loglevel=info -B
